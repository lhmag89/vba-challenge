This is a project to analyze stock prices by ticker between 2018-2020. It will calculate change over the year and identify which tickers had the greatest % increase, greatest % decrease and greatest volume for each year.

## Technologies
Excel VBA

## Installation Guide
Copy scripts in text files to modules in Excel Visual Basic

## Usage
Run the scripts to analyze daily stock ticker information.
OneYearAnalysis.rtf summarizes each ticker for one year.
OneYearAnalysisPlus.rtf finds the greatest % increase, greatest % decrease and greatest volume for that year.
AllYears.rtf will run the analysis for each sheet in the workbook - one sheet has one year's worth of data.
